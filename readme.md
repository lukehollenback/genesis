# Genesis

A simple [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) writting in Go.

Simulates the evolution of generations of individuals with varying traits with breeding,
mutation, and natural selection. The end goal is an individual that has *all* superior traits,
but no inferior traits.

_As a note, this was a programming excercise â€“ not a biology excercise. At best, this was a gross
simplification of reality fueled by
[casual reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause). At worst, it
was an excersie with no corrolation to reality at all._

Ultimately, this project serves to:

* Show use of many of Go's key language features.
* Show a genetic algorithm at work.
